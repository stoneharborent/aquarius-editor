// Runnable check: `npx tsx src/persist/uploadRefs.verify.ts`.
// Asset reference inventory is the basis for deleting files. Missing one means deleting assets that the user is still using. Here are two things to verify:
// ① denoisedSrc (the product of isolate_voice, directly linked to the path without creating the asset) must be counted as a reference;
// ② When the project document cannot be read, it degenerates into scanning the original bytes instead of treating it as a "zero reference".
