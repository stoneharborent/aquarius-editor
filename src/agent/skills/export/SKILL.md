description: Use when a OpenChatCut video editing or creation workflow needs export, render, download, share, final delivery, subtitle-file export, render choice, local-only asset handling, or export fallback explanation.
---

# Export

Use OpenChatCut's export tools for delivery. An export request should call `submit_export` (or `submit_render_job` for async), then use `track_export` for status and final delivery when the result is not returned immediately.

Default policy:

- Prefer `submit_export` when the user asks to export/share/finalize the OpenChatCut timeline.
- Keep originals local by default during editing. Upload originals only when a cloud export/proof needs remote assets and the user has not forbidden upload.
- Do not wrap sandbox `ffmpeg` work as a OpenChatCut tool. Use sandbox `ffmpeg` for full video processing only when the user explicitly asks for a standalone local-file operation outside a OpenChatCut editing workflow. For OpenChatCut editing tasks, do not produce a pre-edited or flattened local render as the primary review/final deliverable; use OpenChatCut export.

## Durable Export

Use `submit_export` for the execution path:

```json
{
  "format": "video",
  "codec": "h264",
  "resolution": "1080p",
  "fps": 30,
  "name": "final-cut"
}
```

Video codec options are `h264` (MP4, default) and `vp8` (WebM). Video frame-rate options match the editor UI: `24`, `25`, `30`, `50`, or `60`; omit `fps` to match the timeline. Audio export is MP3: pass `"format":"audio"` and omit `codec` / `fps` unless you explicitly pass `"codec":"mp3"`.

`submit_export` returns a durable `renderId`. Some export types, such as subtitle files, may complete immediately and return `downloadUrl`; video/audio usually require `track_export` to wait for completion.

After getting each `downloadUrl`:

- Resolve the user's Downloads folder: `~/Downloads` on macOS/Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads` on Windows.
- Before triggering any agent/browser download, check the Downloads folder for fresh Chrome download artifacts from the last few minutes that match the expected export name, extension, or render/download URL basename. Include both completed files and in-progress `.crdownload` files.
- If a matching fresh `.crdownload` exists, do not trigger another download. Wait until Chrome removes the `.crdownload` suffix and the final file size stops changing, then use that completed file.
- If a matching fresh completed file already exists, use it directly instead of downloading again.
- If only older files exist, treat them as collisions, not as the current export.
- Do not overwrite an existing file; choose a safe numbered filename such as `name (1).mp4` when needed.
- Always download the finished export file into the Downloads folder, not a temp/workspace directory.
- Always show the downloaded video inline in chat. If there are multiple exported videos, download all of them and show every preview, not just the first.

If the project contains local-only assets, upload/register cloud-readable replacements before rendering, or use the Local CLI Export path when the user wants to stay local.

Report the returned `renderId` when present. The job is also visible in the editor's top-right export queue, including progress and cancellation. Use `saveToMediaPool:true` when the user asks to retain the result in My Media or when the active workflow explicitly defaults to automatic materialization, such as `livestream-to-clips`; otherwise the default remains a normal downloadable export. For long videos, call `track_export` once with `action:"wait"` and `timeoutSeconds:20`. If it returns `waitExpired:true`, report that the render continues in the background and end the turn. Check it later with `action:"status"`; repeated waits only hold the Agent turn open. Do not start another export for the same timeline while this render is active.

Use `track_export` when the user asks about export/render status, or when the current turn genuinely needs to wait for a submitted video/audio render. Completed connector exports return `downloadUrl`; for every completed entry, download the file to Downloads using the collision-safe rules above and show it inline in chat:

```json
{
  "action": "status",
  "renderIds": "abc123"
}
```

For the latest project export, omit `renderIds` and pass `"latest": true`. `track_progress` is for generation/transcription/upload jobs, not render jobs.

For NLE XML, use `submit_export` with `format:"xml"`:

```json
{
  "format": "xml",
  "nleFormat": "fcp_xml_resolve",
  "timelineId": "abc123"
}
```

`nleFormat` values are `fcp_xml` for Premiere XML (default) and `fcp_xml_resolve` for DaVinci Resolve XML. Omit `timelineId` for the active timeline, or pass a timeline id/prefix for a non-active timeline. Read and report warnings: captions, solids, SVG, unsupported clip attributes, and unrendered motion graphics may be dropped by the XML format. Motion graphics are only represented in XML when a transparent-ProRes MG export flow supplies `motionGraphicRenderKeys`; otherwise the exporter reports them as dropped.

For media-pool source download, use `request_asset_download` on a file-backed source asset. It returns a guarded backend download URL/path for the original source media. Do not use `pull_asset` for user downloads; `pull_asset` is sandbox-only.

For subtitle files, use `submit_export` with `format:"subtitles"`:

```json
{
  "format": "subtitles",
  "subtitleFormat": "srt"
}
```

Formats are `srt` and `txt`. The export uses the captions item's actual timeline word timing, source scope, translation variants, display-text overrides, and pacing fields such as `wordsPerPage` / `maxCharactersPerLine`, and creates a durable downloadable export job. It is appropriate for downloadable subtitle files. It does not yet reuse the browser Remotion caption page planner, so visual line wrapping/page breaks are timing-correct but approximate rather than byte-identical to burned-in caption pagination. For non-active timelines, pass `timelineId` from `manage_timelines` or `read_project`.

For one motion graphic as transparent ProRes 4444, use `export_motion_graphic_prores`:

```json
{
  "itemId": "abc123",
  "filenameMode": "asset"
}
```

Prefer `itemId` when exporting a specific timeline instance, because the item carries live `propertyOverrides` such as edited text. Use `assetId` for a media-pool motion graphic; the backend will use the first timeline instance for that asset when present, matching the editor's media-pool export behavior. For several motion graphics, pass `itemIds` or `assetIds` in one call. Each motion graphic still becomes a separate durable render; use `track_export` with the returned `renderIds` to wait, then download through each returned render download path.

When preparing XML that should reference rendered motion graphics, pass `"filenameMode":"xml"` and the same `timelineId` to `export_motion_graphic_prores`, then keep the returned `motionGraphicRenderKey` / `motionGraphicRenderKeys`; after the render completes, pass those keys and the same `timelineId` in `submit_export.motionGraphicRenderKeys` with `format:"xml"`.

## Local Render (this build)

All rendering is local: `submit_export` / `submit_render_job` drive the local render service (headless Chrome over the same timeline state the editor shows), reading media straight from `/media/uploads/` on disk. There is no S3 requirement, no CLI, and no cloud job to wait on for disk-backed assets.

- `submit_export`: subtitles/XML return synchronously; video/audio also render in-call in this build (long timelines can take a while — warn the user instead of polling).
- `submit_render_job` + `track_export`: the async route — returns a `renderId` immediately, poll with `track_export` (`renderIds` / `latest` / `onlyActive`), then hand the user the returned download path.
- Assets still on `blob:` placeholders (upload in flight) are not renderable yet — wait for `track_progress` target=upload to report ready before submitting.

## Fallbacks

If a render fails because an asset's bytes are missing (placeholder never relinked, file deleted from disk):

1. Ask the user to re-link the asset in My Media (the Relink Offline Media banner) or re-import the file.
2. For URL-sourced media, re-run `download_media` to restore bytes, then resubmit.

Do not tell the user they need to understand HTML-in-Canvas, Remotion, or storage internals unless debugging. Explain at product level:

- "Fast local export"
- "The media is still uploading — wait a moment before exporting"
- "You'll need to relink the local media first"

## Result Trace

For `submit_export`, record:

- `renderId`
- timeline/range/resolution/codec/fps
- that the user can download from the editor render-jobs panel

Record uploaded asset IDs and any fallback tried when cloud export was blocked by local-only assets.
